<sect1 status="final"><title>Overview</title>
	<para>Darkroom mode is for photograpic development of the image you selected from the lighttable. Lots of tools, named
        modules, are available for processing that image.
	</para>
	<para>On the left hand side you have navigation, snapshot and history panels, described in <xref linkend="darkroom panels"/>. 
	In the right hand panel you can see the histogram and a list of modules available for working with the image. 
	At the bottom of the right hand panel you can enable/disable view of individual modules.
	</para>
	<para>Modules are organized into five functional groups: basic, tone, color, correction and effect as described in
        <xref linkend="module groups"/>.
        You either view all modules in one long list or instead click on a group to just display modules belonging to that group.
	</para>
	<para>For those interested in how it works, modules are applied on images following a bottom-to-top order.
	That means, that if you activated the view of all modules (by selecting no groups), the first module to be applied
	will frequently be <link linkend="invert"><emphasis>invert</emphasis></link> at the bottom of the right panel, whereas the last 
        one will be <link linkend="dithering"><emphasis>dithering</emphasis></link> at the top of the right panel.
	That order can not be changed by user, so modules are always applied following the same order.
	</para>

	<para>You can use <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis> to zoom 1:1. A double <emphasis>middle-click</emphasis> takes you to 2:1.
	</para>

	<para>You normally export multiple images from the lighttable view but you can also export the current image directly from the darkroom by using 
        the shortcut <emphasis>ctrl-e</emphasis>. Export parameters are then those currently selected in the lighttable.</para>

<sect1 status="final" id="filmstrip"><title>Filmstrip</title>
	<para>The optional filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images while remaining in the darkroom view. The images viewed are the same
		as the ones in the lighttable view.
	</para>
	<para>The filmstrip can be switched on and off using the shortcut <emphasis>ctrl-f</emphasis>. You can scroll with your mouse to quickly navigate
              through the images and change the height of the filmstrip panel by dragging its top.</para>
