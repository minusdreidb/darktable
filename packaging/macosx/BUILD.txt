How to make disk image with darktable application bundle (64 bit Intel only):

1). Build darktable (and make sure it works) using instructions found in this blog post:
    http://www.darktable.org/2012/08/bringing-current-darktable-to-os-x/
    Macports will need some tuning though, so before you build anything add this line to /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf:
     macosx_deployment_target 10.5
    (10.4 had very limited 64 bit support, so I chose 10.5 as first supported version)
    And edit /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/portconfigure.tcl - change
     default configure.ldflags   {-L${prefix}/lib}
    to
     default configure.ldflags   {"-L${prefix}/lib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names"}
    Be aware that this change will probably be lost after "port selfupdate".
    To have working OpenMP you will also need gcc46:
     sudo port install gcc46
    Configure darktable with this command instead of just "cmake ..":
     CC=gcc-mp-4.6 CXX=g++-mp-4.6 cmake .. -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6
    (if CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set to 10.5 DT crashes on exit from darkroom mode, need to investigate)

2). Download, patch and install gtk-mac-bundler (assuming darktable was cloned into ~/src directory):
     $ cd ~/src
     $ wget http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk-mac-bundler/0.6/gtk-mac-bundler-0.6.1.tar.bz2
     $ tar -xf gtk-mac-bundler-0.6.1.tar.bz2
     $ cd gtk-mac-bundler-0.6.1
     $ patch -p1 < ../darktable/packaging/macosx/gtk-mac-bundler-0.6.1.patch
     $ make install

3). You will need to rebuild gtk2 with custom configure flag. Add these lines to gtk2 Portfile in your local macports repository:
     variant bundle {
         configure.args-append --enable-quartz-relocation
     }
    Update index file and reinstall gtk2 (assuming local repository is in ~/ports directory):
     $ cd ~/ports
     $ portindex
     $ sudo port install gtk2 +bundle
    The problem is that with this flag gtk2 works reliably only when included in bundle, so if you need working system gtk2 you will need to revert this change
    after you're done with bundle creation. To do that you can just run this command:
     $ sudo port install gtk2 -bundle

4). Now preparation is done, run image creating script, it should create darktable.dmg in current (packaging/macosx) directory:
     $ cd ~/src/darktable/packaging/macosx
     $ ./make-app-bundle
